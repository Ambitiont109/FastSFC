## Setup

**Create virtualenv for project**
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

**Clone repository, install packages and configure settings**
```
cd path/to/app/repository
pip3 install -r requirements.pip
cp app/settings/local.sample.py app/settings/local.py
```

For errors installing `mysqlclient`, please refer to the package [docs](https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python). On macOS, you may have to:

1. Install MySQL development headers and libraries: `brew install mysql-connector-c`
2. Fix bug on MySQL Connector/C

```
which mysql_config
vim path/to/mysql_config
```

On macOS, on or about line 112, change:

```
# Create options
libs="-L$pkglibdir"
libs="$libs -l "
```

to

```
# Create options
libs="-L$pkglibdir"
libs="$libs -lmysqlclient -lssl -lcrypto"
```

3. Configure SSL by adding exports suggested in `brew info openssl` to `~/.bash_profile`

**Create and prepare MySQL database**
Ensure DATABASES in app/settings/local.py is configured to connect to MySQL database
```
mysql -u {{ mysql_user }}
create database {{ db_name }}
exit
```

** Seed database**

Download and install seed database from [url](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nj9MKAMwonmMhQj92TZR0-VN_abCitQ5). (will take a while as database is 1.5GB)

Migrate to update table structure.
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

```
npm install
```

**Start project**
